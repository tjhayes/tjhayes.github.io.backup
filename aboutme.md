My name is TJ Hayes. Fun facts:

- I grew up in Delaware.
- I was named after my older sister. But, our names are different. That's a joke that may take a minute.
- I like to start sentences with I. And end them that way, when I can.

Interests:

- God, the Bible, Jesus, Christianity
- (how do you put a second item after starting such a list?)
- Sourdough bread
- Fixing my cars
- Linux
- Reading
