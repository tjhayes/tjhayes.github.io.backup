I was reading Ephesians 1 yesterday when a phrase caught my eye: "in the Beloved" (Ephesians 1:6). So, I spent some time meditating on it.

The whole verse goes like this:

> to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. (Eph 1:6)

The verb *he has blessed* is the verb form of the Greek word for grace. So, a very literal translation of this verse could be "to the praise of his glorious grace, which he graced us in the Beloved." So God's outpouring of his grace, his undeserved salvation grace to us in Christ, is said to be graced to us, or grace-given to us. And, Paul includes this key phrase "in the Beloved." 

Now, the word "Beloved" obviously refers to Christ. That is what we wouuld call the referential meaning. The word "Beloved" refers to Christ. So, Paul could have written "with which he has blessed us in Christ", or "in him." And Paul does use those words throughout Ephesians. So, what is the significance of this new phrase, "in the Beloved"?

Paul is saying that God's grace to us comes to us because God loves Jesus. I'll say that again. God's grace to us comes to us because God loves Jesus. And because we are in Christ, we are incorporated in this one whom God the Father loves. At Jesus' baptism, God the Father said, "This is my son, whom I love; in him I am well-pleased" (Mark 1:11).



And in the Gospel of John.
We live inside the Father's love for the Son. By being in Christ by faith, we are brought into the very love that the Father has for the Son.

As Christians, we know that God loves us. We sing songs about God's love and we treasure it. But, at least for me, sometimes between Sundays I don't really feel that I am right in the middle of God's love. Or maybe it's that God's love feels kind of remote. Sometimes, I can "know" that God loves me even when I don't feel loved. Does this resonate with you? 

Jesus prayed something very similar to this in John 17, in what is called his High Priestly Prayer. Listen to his last request that he made for you and me:


> I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, **that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them**.‚Äù (John 17:26)


Imagine it like an eternal waterfall, this love of the Father pouring down forever over the Son. When we put our trust in Christ, we join Christ in his waterfall. We don't merely get our own waterfall of God's love for us. That would be you and me with our own smaller waterfalls of God's love, and Jesus still standing under the largest waterfall. We don't even stand right next to Christ under the shower of water that he is receiving from the Father, happy to receive the water that bounces off of Christ. Rather, we are picked up by him and put on his shoulders, so that we are directly in the flow of the water coming down upon him. We join Christ under the infinite, eternal flow of God's waterfall of love for his own Son. This sounds crazy to me, but I believe it is true.
