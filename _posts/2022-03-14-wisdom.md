Wisdom is not within us, but must be sought from God.

> Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool,  
> but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.  
> (Proverbs 28:26 esv)

Wisdom comes from outside ourselves. We must think, but not trust our own thinking.

Although culture is always sending us mixed messages because it is not monolithic, it tells us to think for ourselves and trust ourselves. And, in pride, we often act like we know what we are doing.

> A wicked man puts on a bold face,  
> but the upright gives thought to his ways.  
> (Proverbs 21:29 esv)  

But, God teaches us to be open to his truth and wisdom, which come to us from outside ourselves:
- Through parents and teachers
- Through observation of the natural world
- Through God's Word
- Through God speaking to us

Our thinking should not be a closed system, like the view of the universe in materialistic philosophy. In that worldview, God cannot act on the world in miracles or revelation, because the of the presupposition that the universe is a closed naturalistic system. But, the Bible reveals that although the created world certainly does have patterns and laws by which it normally operates, the universe is also open to God's influence at any time and way he chooses. The universe is not closed but open to God. So also, we must let God speak into our thinking.
